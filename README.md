## What I Learned

During the development of KINO, I gained several new skills and knowledge, including:

- Vue.js: This was my first time using Vue.js, and I learned how to develop web apps with Vue.js.
- TailwindCSS: This was my first time using TailwindCSS, and I learned how to create responsive and stylish user interfaces.
- Web Scraping: I learned how to scrape a website with Python to obtain data for the "coming soon" section of the app.
- Docker: I learned how to use Docker for containerization of the application, making it easier to manage dependencies and deploy the app.
- Firebase Hosting: I learned how to use Firebase Hosting to host and deploy the web app, making it accessible to users online.

## Conclusion

KINO is a project that showcases my skills in front-end web development using Vue.js, Firebase authentication and Firestore for user authentication and data management, TailwindCSS for responsive UI design, and web scraping with Python. It was a great learning experience, and I am excited about the potential for future development of KINO, including adding more social features and implementing recommendation systems. I hope you enjoy using KINO as a platform to share your opinions on movies and TV shows with your friends!
